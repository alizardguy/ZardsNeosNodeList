The Get Texture 3D Pixel node returns the color of a pixel by locating it on the input 3D texture according to the specified position. This node is distinct from from the Sample Texture3D UVW node as it accepts an int3 instead of an float3; this ensures the sampling remains constrained to individual pixels rather than being interpolated across pixels.
