The Sample Texture3D UVW node samples the color of a pixel by locating it on the input 3D texture according to the specified position in UVW space. This node is distinct from from the Get Texture 3D Pixel node as it accepts a float3 instead of an int3; this lets the sampling be interpolated across pixels rather than being constrained to individual pixels.
