The Get Texture 2D Pixel node returns the color of a pixel by locating it on the input 2D texture according to the specified position. This node is distinct from from the Sample Texture2D UV node as it accepts an int2 instead of an float2; this ensures the sampling remains constrained to individual pixels rather than being interpolated across pixels.
